            <h1>COVID-19 vaccines</h1>
            <h3>Descriptions of each vaccine being offered</h3>
            <p>There are two types of vaccines that have been approved for distribution in the United States. They are messenger RNA and viral vector.</p>
            <p>Messenger RNA vaccines teaches our cells how to make protein that triggers a response in your immune system.
            The vaccine doesn’t enter the nucleus of the cell (where DNA is stored). Both Moderna and Pfizer are messenger RNA vaccines. </p>
            <p>Viral vector vaccines uses a modified or harmless virus to create and deliver instructions to the cell to begin building protection.
            The instructions aren’t delivered in the form of genetic material. Additionally, they don’t combine with any of a person’s DNA.
            Janssen is a viral vector vaccine.</p>
            <p><strong>As of April 13, 2021:</strong> The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control calls for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-fda-cdc.html">immediate pause</a>
            on the use and distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The sudden halt is due to six recipients developing a rare blood clotting disorder. 
            The administrations urge states to follow suit and will continue to examine the safety and cases thoroughly. </p>

            <h3>Vaccination Locations in MA</h3>
            <p>Massachusetts has seven mass vaccination sites throughout the state. The mass sites include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hynes Convention Center</li>
                    <li>Gillette Stadium</li>
                    <li>Reggie Lewis Center</li>
                    <li>DoubleTree Hotel - Danvers</li>
                    <li>Eastfield Mall - Springfield</li>
                    <li>Natick Mall</li>
                    <li>Former Circuit City - Dartmouth</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Mass vaccination sites are high volume, large venue sites that offer the most appointments. Because of it's high demand, you must preregister for an appointment to receive the vaccination.
            You will then be contacted via call, text, or email when it's your turn to schedule an appointment. </p>
            <button><a href="https://vaccinesignup.mass.gov/#/" alt="Preregistration Form for Massachusetts COVID-19 Vaccines">
            Click here to preregister</a></button>
            <p>If you don't want to go through the process of preregistering at a mass vaccination site, Massachusetts is also offering vaccinations at pharmacies,
            health care providers, and other community locations.</p>
            <p>Since these sites aren't in such high demand compared to mass locations, there are fewer appointments.
            The upside is that the availability of appointments are updated daily.</p>

        <div id="myths">
            <h1>Vaccine myths</h1>
            <h3>Misconceptions of the effectiveness/safety of the vaccines</h3>
            <h4>The vaccines shouldn't be trusted and aren't safe. They were rapidly developed and tested.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> Yes, it’s true that the vaccines were developed quickly. But, this is because the outbreak of COVID-19 was an emergency situation.
            Therefore, quick and emergency response/action was needed. Additionally, manufacturers and researchers were already in the developmental stages of the vaccine.
            This granted them the capability to have a head-start on the process, making the roll-out quick.
            </p>
            <h4>I already had COVID-19, so I don't need the vaccine.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> There is not enough information for how long after infection that someone is protected from getting the virus again.
                This is referred to natural immunity.
            </p>
            <h4>There are extremely dangerous side effects from the vaccine. One of them includes death.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> The vaccine causes short-term mild to moderate reactions. Some side effects include headaches, chills, fatigue, and sometimes flu.
                The side effects typically resolve on their own without complications or injury and takes a few days to disappear.
                Experts at <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-myth-versus-fact">John Hopkins Medicine</a> recommends to carry your EpiPen to your appointment if you have severe allergies. If you have further concerns, consult with your
                doctor to assess risks and for more information, so that you can receive your vaccination safely.
            </p>
            <h4>More people will die from the vaccine than they will from the virus itself.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE: </strong> According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked">Mayo Clinic</a>, this claim circulated throughout social media and is false.
                COVID-19’s mortality rate is between 1-2%. People should still be vaccinated even if there’s a high survival rate.
                We should take into consideration others that are vulnerable to the virus and not just the survival rates.
            </p>
            <h4>The COVID vaccines will cause infertility and miscarriage.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> As stated by Mayo Clinic, this is another piece of misinformation that spread online.
                The claim believes that the antibodies of the spike protein from COVID-19 produced from the vaccines would bind with the placental proteins.
                The supposed bind would then prevent pregnancy. There is no concrete evidence that supports this.
            </p>
            <h4>I can get sick with COVID from the vaccines.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> According to the  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">Centers for Disease Control and Protection</a>, the vaccines don’t contain the live virus.
                Therefore, you can’t get sick with COVID-19. You may encounter some side effects that were mentioned above.
                This is completely normal. If anything, it’s a good sign because it means that your body is establishing a foundation to protect you against the virus.
                Building immunity, protection against the virus, takes about 2-3 weeks after complete vaccination.
                Being fully vaccinated is defined as 2 shots of either Moderna or Pfizer or 1 shot of Janssen.

        <div id="FAQs">
            <h1>FAQs</h1>
            <h3>Frequently asked questions about the vaccines</h3>
            <h4>Do I have to pay for the vaccine?</h4>
            <p> According to <a href="https://www.bmc.org/covid-19-vaccine/frequently-asked-questions">Boston Medical Center</a>, no.
                The federal government has made it their mission to provide the vaccine at no cost.
                Additionally, insurance companies and providers in MA agreed to provide the vaccine without out-of-pocket and co-payment fees.
            </p>
            <h4>Can I choose which vaccine I get?</h4>
            <p>You can’t choose which vaccine to get. All vaccines are offered at various locations and it depends which is in supply each time. Each vaccine has undergone strict reviews and are proven to be highly effective and safe. If you get Pfizer or Moderna for your first dose, you must get the second dose as the same vaccine of your first. One shot is only necessary for <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-by-u-s-fda-for-emergency-usefirst-single-shot-vaccine-in-fight-against-global-pandemic" alt="Johnson & Johnson">Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Are there any side effects?</h4>
            <p> As stated under the common myths section, the side effects from the vaccine are generally mild.
                Some effects include headache, fatigue, chills, and soreness of the injection site.
                These symptoms resolve on their own and takes a few days to disappear.
                You have the ability to take over the counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to manage the side effects.
                It’s not recommended to take them before your vaccination.
            </p>
            <h4>I can stop wearing my mask once I'm vaccinated, right?</h4>
            <p> Wrong. You should continue to follow protocols, such as wearing your mask, to curb the spread of COVID-19. There is still research being conducted if people who have been vaccinated have the capability to spread COVID-19. Other protocols that you should continue to follow include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staying six feet away from others</li>
                <li>Avoiding large crowds</li>
                <li>Avoiding large gatherings (more than six people) </li>
                <li>Washing/sanitizing your hands frequently</li>
                <li>Quarantining for two weeks if you've been exposed to someone that contracted COVID-19</li>
