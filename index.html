            <h1>COVID-19 Vaccines</h1>
            <h3>Descriptions of each available vaccine</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> has approved two types of vaccines for distribution in the United States. They are messenger RNA and viral vector.</p>
            <p>Messenger RNA vaccines teach our cells how to make the protein that triggers a response in your immune system. The vaccine doesn’t enter the nucleus of the cell (where DNA is stored). Both Moderna and Pfizer are messenger RNA vaccines.</p>
            <p>Viral vector vaccines use a modified or harmless virus to create and deliver instructions to the cell to begin building protection. The instructions aren’t delivered in the form of genetic material. Additionally, they don’t combine with any of a person’s DNA. Janssen is a viral vector vaccine.</p>
            <p><strong>On April 13th, 2021:</strong> The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control calls for an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-fda-cdc.html">immediate pause</a>
            on the use and distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The sudden halt is due to six recipients (*15 J&J vaccine recipients as of April 26th, 2021) developing a rare blood clotting disorder.</p>
            <p><strong>On April 23rd, 2021:</strong> the FDA and CDC has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-science-business-europe-coronavirus-vaccine-839bf6a7c857b25df04078402b4d7b8a">resumed</a> the distribution and use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine for all adults in the U.S., and "the small [blood] clot risk could be handled with warnings to help younger women decide if they should use that shot or an alternative." </p>

            <h3>Vaccination Locations in MA</h3>
            <p>Massachusetts has seven mass vaccination sites throughout the state. The mass sites include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hynes Convention Center</li>
                    <li>Gillette Stadium</li>
                    <li>Reggie Lewis Center</li>
                    <li>DoubleTree Hotel - Danvers</li>
                    <li>Eastfield Mall - Springfield</li>
                    <li>Natick Mall</li>
                    <li>Former Circuit City - Dartmouth</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Mass vaccination sites are high volume, large venue sites that offer the most appointments. Because of its high demand, you must preregister for an appointment to receive the vaccination.
            You will then be contacted via call, text, or email when it's your turn to schedule an appointment. </p>
            <button><a href="https://vaccinesignup.mass.gov/#/" alt="Preregistration Form for Massachusetts COVID-19 Vaccines">
            Click here to preregister</a></button>
            <p>If you don't want to go through the process of preregistering at a mass vaccination site, Massachusetts is also offering vaccinations at pharmacies, health care providers, and other community locations.</p>
            <p>Since these sites aren't in such high demand compared to mass locations, there are fewer appointments.
            The upside is that the availability of appointments is updated daily.</p>

        <div id="myths">
            <h1>Vaccine Myths</h1>
            <h3>Misconceptions of the effectiveness/safety of the vaccines</h3>
            <h4>The vaccines shouldn't be trusted and aren't safe. They were rapidly developed and tested.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> Yes, the vaccines have indeed developed quickly. But, this is because the outbreak of COVID-19 was an emergency.
            Therefore, a quick and urgent response/action was necessary. Additionally, manufacturers and researchers were already in the developmental stages of the vaccine.
            This granted them the capability to have a head-start on the process, making the roll-out quick.
            </p>
            <h4>I already had COVID-19, so I don't need the vaccine.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> There is not enough information on how long a body can protect itself from getting the virus again after being infected by COVID-19. This refers to natural immunity.
            </p>
            <h4>There are extremely dangerous side effects from the vaccine. One of them includes death.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> The vaccine causes short-term mild to moderate reactions. Some side effects include headaches, chills, fatigue, and sometimes flu.
                The side effects typically resolve on their own without complications or injury and take a few days to disappear.
                Experts at <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-myth-versus-fact">John Hopkins Medicine</a> recommend carrying your EpiPen to your appointment if you have severe allergies. If you have further concerns, consult with your doctor to assess possible risks so that you can receive your vaccination safely.
            </p>
            <h4>More people will die from the vaccine than they will from the virus itself.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE: </strong> According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked">Mayo Clinic</a>, this claim circulated throughout social media.
                The mortality rate of COVID-19 is between 1-2%. People should still get vaccinated even if the survival rate is high. We should take into consideration others who are vulnerable to the virus rather than just the survival rates.
            </p>
            <h4>The COVID vaccines will cause infertility and miscarriage.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> As stated by Mayo Clinic, this is another piece of misinformation that spreads online. 
                The claim believes that the antibodies of the spike protein from COVID-19 produced from the vaccines would bind with the placental proteins.
                The supposed bind would then prevent pregnancy. There is no concrete evidence that supports this.
            </p>
            <h4>I can get sick with COVID from the vaccines.</h4>
            <p> <strong>FALSE:</strong> According to the  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">Centers for Disease Control and Protection</a>, the vaccines don’t contain the live virus.
                Therefore, you can’t get sick with COVID-19. You may encounter some side effects that were mentioned above.
                This is completely normal. Side effects are a good sign because it means that your body is establishing a foundation to protect you against the virus. Building immunity (protection against the virus) takes about 2-3 weeks after complete vaccination. Being fully vaccinated is defined as 2 shots of either Moderna or Pfizer or 1 shot of Janssen.

        <div id="FAQs">
            <h1>FAQs</h1>
            <h3>Frequently asked questions about the vaccines</h3>
            <h4>Do I have to pay for the vaccine?</h4>
            <p> According to <a href="https://www.bmc.org/covid-19-vaccine/frequently-asked-questions">Boston Medical Center</a>, no.
                The federal government has made it their mission to provide the vaccine at no cost.
                Additionally, insurance companies and providers in MA agreed to distribute the vaccine without out-of-pocket and co-payment fees.
            </p>
            <h4>Can I choose which vaccine I get?</h4>
            <p>You can’t choose which vaccine to get. Various locations offer all available vaccines, and it depends on which are in supply each time. Each vaccine has undergone strict reviews and is proven to be highly effective and safe. If you get Pfizer or Moderna for your first dose, you must receive the second dose as the same vaccine as your first. One shot is needed only for <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-by-u-s-fda-for-emergency-usefirst-single-shot-vaccine-in-fight-against-global-pandemic" alt="Johnson & Johnson">Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Can I get the vaccine if I'm pregnant?</h4>
            <p>Yes, if you are pregnant you have the option to get vaccinated. Experts believe that the COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to cause serious threats. Similarly to serious allergies, it's recommended to have a discussion with your doctor if you have any concerns.</p>
            <h4>Are there any side effects?</h4>
            <p> As stated under the common myths section, the side effects from the vaccine are generally mild.
                Some side effects include headache, fatigue, chills, and soreness of the injection site. These symptoms are temporary, taking only a few days to disappear. If needed, you can take over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to manage the side effects. But it’s not recommended to take them before your vaccination.
            </p>
            <h4>I can stop wearing my mask once I'm vaccinated, right?</h4>
            <p> Wrong. You should continue to follow protocols, such as wearing your mask to curb the spread of COVID-19. Professionals are still researching if a fully vaccinated person can spread COVID-19. Other protocols that you should continue, regardless of being vaccinated, include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staying six feet away from others</li>
                <li>Avoiding large crowds</li>
                <li>Avoiding large gatherings (more than six people) </li>
                <li>Washing/sanitizing your hands frequently</li>
                <li>Quarantining for two weeks if you were exposed to someone that contracted COVID-19</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>If I'm currently sick with COVID-19, can I get vaccinated?</h4>
            <p>No. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">CDC</a> states that those who have any symptoms should isolate and wait to be vaccinated. This also extends to those that get COVID before their second vaccination.</p>
